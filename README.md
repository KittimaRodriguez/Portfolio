| [Bellabeat Fitness Tracking App](https://github.com/KittimaRodriguez/data-analytics-case-study/tree/main/bellabeat-case-study) | R (ggplot2, dplyr), Data Visualization | Conducted an in-depth analysis of fitness tracker data to uncover user activity trends, sleep patterns, and sedentary behavior. The project involved extracting and processing raw data, performing transformations using R (`dplyr` and `lubridate`), segmenting users by activity level, and visualizing insights with `ggplot2`. Findings were used to generate data-driven recommendations for Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy. |
